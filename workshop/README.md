# Get started with GitHub Actions

## Goals

In this workshop, you will learn how to build a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow in GitHub actions for a Python project

| **Goal**                      | Create a CI workflow with GitHub Actions                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What will you learn**       | The basics of creating a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on code changes|
| **What you'll need**          | [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) |
| **Duration**                  | 1 Hour |
| **Microsoft Cloud Topics taught**                 | GitHub Actions |
| **Just want to try the app or see the solution?** | # TODO |
| **Slides** | [Powerpoint](slides.pptx)

## Pre-Learning
- [Create and manage projects in Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/python-create-manage-projects/)
- [Build continuous integration (CI) workflows by using GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/github-actions-ci/)

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## What students will learn

<!-- *In this area, describe the scenario and intended solution, paraphrasing what is in the module or creating a brief description here*

Example: Have you ever wanted to visit a museum virtually or explore its collections right from your home computer? In this workshop, use an API, or Application Programming Interface, to learn more about a museum collection. -->

In this workshop, you will build a Continuous Integration workflow for a Python project using GitHub Actions. The final workflow will:

1. Validate code style
2. Check code syntax
3. Run automated tests
everytime a new commit is pushed to the project.

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:
1. Setup a GitHub Actions workflow
2. Configure automated syntax checking, linting, and testing in the workflow
3. Debug workflow logs to identify problems and fix them

## Next steps

*links to Microsoft Learn to further learning progress, and/or a path to certifications*

[AZ-400: Implement CI with Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-400-implement-ci-azure-pipelines-github-actions/)

[Build and deploy applications to Azure by using GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/github-actions-cd/)

## Practice

*suggest, or add as an addendum, a way to extend students knowledge of the topic by creating a new app or demo that builds on the original workshop materials.*

Now that you know how to build a CI workflow for Python, you can apply this knowledge to create a CI workflow for projects with any other language. Can you set up a CI workflow for past projects? Can you modify this workflow to run on different branches?
